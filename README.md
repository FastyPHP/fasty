# Fasty - the fast and simple PHP framework
(Currently under heavy development)
## Installation

Installing Fasty is **super** easy, just follow the steps bellow

1. Download the repository and place it into your web root
1. Set the web servers root directory to the /Public folder
1. Open console/command prompt and cd into the Fasty root folder
1. Run composer install and wait until composer finishes downloading the necessary files (if don't have composer set up, you can do so by visiting this link: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md )
1. Set up the config.php file to match your own settings
1. Create something awesome!

Fasty doesn't require any console work on its own but it needs it for the initial installation
